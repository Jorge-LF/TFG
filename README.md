Fiji Macro: Moving ROI pluggin developed by the Advanced Light Microscopy Facility in EMBL
How to use:
1-Pre-process the movie as desired (max projection, filtering...)
2-Using the Pluggin Manual Tracking (Installed by default) create a new track and follow the region of interest in the movie.
Every click in the will mark the position and jump to the next frame. Repeat until finished
3-Run the Macro and select a specific diameter size for the ROI.
4-The macro will ask to select the Movie and also the results obtained from the Manual Tracking (with the positions)
5-The generated results will give a mean intensity of the ROI area in the defined position at each time point
